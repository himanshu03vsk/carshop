### Understanding of the implementation of React with the Static Pages in accordance with Phase 2 Guidelines

- The only part where our team has implemented react is to setup the routes, it is implemented in the app.jsx files.
- The **src/pages** contains the code that implements the functionality that redirects to our static html files
- The **public/assests/static** has all the static html and corresponding css files.




### Files

- **src/App.jsx**: The main application component.
- **src/index.jsx**: The entry point of the application.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file.
